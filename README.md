plan!

## Idea Summary
You control a colony of semi-sentient plant-based lifeforms on their grand journey through the post-apocalyptic remains of a civilization filled with automated factories and mechanical dangers.
These factories are heavily guarded by automated systems and defences

You play as a commander to a small group of powerful troops

Turn based

Friendly troops have an action limit per turn
 - actions are designated before ending turn, and are carried out all at once after clicking end turn
